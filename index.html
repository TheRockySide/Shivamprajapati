                    <h1> Indian Army</h1><img class="armysign1" src="armysign.png" width="250px" alt="">
                    <p>The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces.
                        The
                        President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is
                        the
                        Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with
                        the
                        rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The
                        Indian
                        Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British
                        Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states, which were merged into the national army
                        after
                        independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have
                        participated in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre
                        honours before and after Independence.
                    </p>
                    <p>The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, to
                        defend the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and to maintain peace and
                        security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural
                        calamities and other disturbances, such as Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned
                        by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power,
                        alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. The army has been involved in four wars with
                        neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major operations undertaken by the army include
                        Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, and Operation Cactus. The army has conducted large
                        peacetime exercises such as Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer, and it has also been an
                        active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions, including those in Cyprus,
                        Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique, South
                        Sudan, and Somalia.</p>

                    <h2>Equipments:</h2>
                    <p>Most of the army equipment is imported, but efforts are being made to manufacture indigenous
                        equipment. The Defence Research and Development Organisation has developed a range of weapons
                        for the Indian Army, including small arms, artillery, radars, and the Arjun tank. All Indian
                        military small-arms are manufactured under the umbrella administration of the Ordnance Factories
                        Board, with principal firearm manufacturing facilities in Ichhapore, Cossipore, Kanpur,
                        Jabalpur, and Tiruchirapalli. The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) rifle, which has been
                        successfully deployed since 1997, is a product of Rifle Factory Ishapore, while ammunition is
                        manufactured at Khadki, and possibly at Bolangir.</p>
                    <h4>Aircraft</h4>
                    <p>The Army Aviation Corps is the main body of the Indian Army for tactical air transport,
                        reconnaissance, and medical evacuation, while the Indian Air Force's helicopter assets are
                        responsible for assisting army troop transport and close air support. The Aviation Corps
                        operates approximately 150 helicopters. The Indian army had projected a requirement for a
                        helicopter that can carry loads of up to 750 kilograms (1,650 lb) to heights of 7,000 m (23,000
                        ft) on the Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir. Flying at these heights poses unique challenges
                        due to the rarefied atmosphere. The Indian Army will induct the HAL Light Utility Helicopter to
                        replace its ageing fleet of Chetaks and Cheetahs, some of which were deployed more than three
                        decades ago.

                        On 13 October 2012, the defence minister gave control of attack helicopters to the Indian Army,
                        which had formerly rested the Indian Air force.</p>
                    <h4>Future developments</h4>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8224; F-INSAS is the Indian Army's principal infantry modernisation programme,
                        which aims to modernise the army's 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020. The
                        programme aims to upgrade the infantry to a multi-calibre rifle with an under-barrel grenade
                        launcher, as well as bulletproof jackets and helmets.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8224; India is currently re-organising its mechanised forces to achieve strategic
                        mobility and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. India proposes to
                        progressively deploy as many as 248 Arjun main battle tanks (MBT) and to develop and deploy the
                        Arjun MK-II variant, as well as 1,657 Russian-made T-90S MBTs. The army is procuring 2,000 night
                        vision devices for T-72 tanks, for Rs 10 billion; 1,200 for T-90 tanks, for Rs 9.60 billion; and
                        1,780 for infantry combat vehicles, for Rs 8.60 billion. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8224; In 2008, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved raising two new infantry
                        mountain divisions (with around 15,000 combat soldiers each) and an artillery brigade. These
                        divisions were likely to be armed with ultralight howitzers.</p>
                    <h4>Tanks and Armoured vehicles</h4>
                    <p> &#8224; <b>Futuristic Battle Tank (FMBT)</b>

                        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It was developed to replace old Soviet-era
                        infantry fighting vehicles (BMP) and APCs in service with the Indian army. It is expected to
                        join the Indian Army by 2017.</p>

                    <p>&#8224; <b>4. Anti-Tank Guided Missiles</b></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Nag Anti-tank guided missile – ground and air-launched variant.</p>
                    <p>&#8224; The Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme is an initiative to develop and deploy a
                        multi-layered ballistic missile defence system to protect India from ballistic missile attacks.
                        It is a double-tiered system consisting of two interceptor missiles, namely the Prithvi Air
                        Defence (PAD) missile for high altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile
                        for lower altitude interception</p>
                    <h4>Artillery</h4>
                    <p>Under the Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan (FARP) of 2010, the army plans to procure 3000 to
                        4000 pieces of artillery at the cost of ₹200 billion (US$3 billion). This includes purchasing
                        1580 towed, 814 mounted, 180 self-propelled wheeled, 100 self-propelled tracked, and 145
                        ultra-light 155 mm/39 calibre guns. The requirement for artillery guns would be met with
                        indigenous development and production.[201] The FARP has resulted in a collaboration with Korea
                        over the K-9 Vajra-T (an offshoot of the Korean K9 Thunder), some of which will be built
                        domestically by Larsen & Toubro. The K9 contract was signed in the midst of the failure of the
                        Dhanush (howitzer) programme. As well the fully indigenous towed artillery ATAGS howitzer had a
                        successful field trials in spring 2022 at the Pokhran Field Firing Range. It is produced by
                        Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems Limited.</p>

                    <p>Earlier development efforts of the DRDO to meet the Indian Army's small arms requirements—namely
                        the Excalibur rifle, which was meant to replace the INSAS rifle in service; the Multi Caliber
                        Individual Weapon System (MCIWS); and the Modern Sub Machine Carbine, a combined venture of ARDE
                        & OFB to develop an assault carbine for the Indian Army based on a platform of experiences from
                        the INSAS rifle—have been halted.

                    <p> To meet the needs of the rest of its soldiers, the army has selected the Russian 7.62 mm
                        AK-103/AK-203 assault rifle as a "Make in India" project to manufacture 650,000 rifles through a

                            <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks third amongst the air forces of the world. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal. After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed.</p>
                            <p>Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.</p>
                            <p>The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF.As of 1 July 2017, 170,576 personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force. The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002, Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.</p>
